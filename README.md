# State-C

State-C is a tool for easily embedding data in a binary. 
State-C takes a data described in a simple language and converts it into assembly code (NASM syntax) which dumps this data in the data section.
This assembly can be processed into a C object file and linked with a larger executable. 
Data is accessed via labels defined in the header file also produced by State-C.
